Here is a list of topics that would be appropriate for the capstone project:

- Creating an analysis report with R Markdown  
- Applying the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to a machine learning problem 
- Making a map visualization with `ggplot` 
- Creating an interactive visualization with shiny 
- Performing deep learning with `keras` 
- Applying principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality of a wide dataset 
- Demonstrating how to deal with Big data in R 
- Performing network analysis and visualizing a network 
- Performing machine learning on videos, images, or audio files 

The above is a preliminary list. Students are welcome to propose a topic not included in the list above.

## Timeline

- Week 2: Find a team member to work with.

- Week 3: Identify a motivating dataset to work with.

- Week 4: Discuss idea with instructor and get approval to proceed.

- week 5: Progress meeting with instructor.

- week 6: Progress meeting with instructor.

- week 7: Progress meeting with instructor.

- week 8: Draft product ready (R script, Rmd report, shiny website, etc.).

- week 9: Presentation ready.

- week 10: Present your work to the class.

## Deliverables
- You will present (as a team) your project to the class in the form of a .ppt document. The presentation may also include a live demo in R if this's useful. You have a total of 12 minutes to present your work. 
- 24 hours before the date of the presentation, the .ppt file, .R scripts, and datasets used shall be made available to the course Instructor via a shared folder.

## Grading rubric
- Meeting with Instructor to discuss the progress of the project (10%)
- Delivering the files in final form by the due date (10%)
- How well you explain the main theoretical concept(s) (20%)
- How well you explain the steps involved in the analysis/modeling (20%)
- Soundness of your approach to the problem (e.g. did you miss some obvious steps) (20%) 
- Performance on answering judgesâ€™ questions (Individual basis) (20%)
